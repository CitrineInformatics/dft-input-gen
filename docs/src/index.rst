dftinpgen
+++++++++

Unopinionated input file generator for DFT codes.

``dftinpgen`` generates input files from user-specified key-value pairs. It does
not validate values, and simply formats the key-values pairs for the DFT code of
interest. It also provides default settings for some common calculation types,
which can be used to build more customized input settings.

Installation instructions can be found here_.

Example use cases of the API and input options will be added here soon.
